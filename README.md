# mcu-boot
a very low quality collection of software and scripts that can be used to virtualize one specific version of the tesla car software (2019.20.4.2.model3)\
it's very much a prototype, do not expect stuff to work or be properly done (i never wanted to make it public in this state, but i'd rather do it myself than have someone else do it for me)

rough usage instructions and description can be found in `readme.txt` (the readme i originally included when i shared this with a small group of people) but you have to run download.sh first as i didn't want to put binaries in the repo\
the hacked-up scripts are documented somewhat, so by reading them you should at least have a little clue of what is happening
